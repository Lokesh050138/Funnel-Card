## Interactive Coding Funnel - HTML File

This repository contains `InteractiveCodingFunnel.html`, an engaging HTML file designed to display a step-by-step learning path for coding using a visually appealing card format with Lottie animations.

### Features

- **Lottie Animation Integration**: The card utilizes the Lottie animation library to incorporate a dynamic SVG animation, providing a more interactive and visually engaging experience for users. The animation is loaded directly from a URL and plays in a loop, adding a modern touch to the page.

- **Interactive Card Design**: The card is styled with smooth hover effects that translate and elevate the card when hovered over, giving it a 3D-like effect. This enhances user interaction and keeps viewers engaged.

- **Structured Learning Path**: The content of the card is structured into three stages of coding learning:
  - **Beginner**: Introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on building foundational web development skills.
  - **Intermediate**: Covers advanced JavaScript techniques, frameworks like React, and building dynamic web applications.
  - **Advanced**: Focuses on full-stack development, databases, APIs, server-side programming, and preparing for a professional career in web development.

- **Modern Aesthetics and Styling**: The card features a clean, modern design with rounded corners, shadows, and gradient backgrounds. It uses a professional color palette that complements the coding theme, creating a visually appealing layout.

- **Responsive Layout**: The card is designed to be responsive and adapts to various screen sizes. Centered on the page using Flexbox, it maintains its visual appeal on both desktop and mobile devices.

- **Call-to-Action Button**: The card includes an "Explore More" button at the bottom, encouraging users to take further action. The button has hover effects that change its background color and slightly lift it, making it more interactive.
